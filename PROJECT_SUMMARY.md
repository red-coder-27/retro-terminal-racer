## 📊 Code Statistics

- **Lines of Code**: 481
- **Functions**: 20
- **Classes**: 4 (GameState enum, Player/Obstacle dataclasses, TerminalRacer main class)
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.6+ standard library only
- **File Size**: ~17KB

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns
1. **State Machine**: Clean game state management (Menu → Playing → Paused → Game Over)
2. **Entity-Component**: Separate data structures for Player and Obstacle entities
3. **Game Loop**: Fixed timestep loop with input → update → render phases

### Key Technical Solutions
1. **Smooth Animation**: Frame-based animation system for lane dividers and movement
2. **Non-blocking Input**: Curses configuration for responsive controls
3. **Collision Detection**: Multi-point collision checking for wider car sprite
4. **Dynamic Difficulty**: Time-based speed and obstacle density scaling
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Emoji fallbacks and error handling

## 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics

### Controls
- **Movement**: Arrow keys or A/D for lane changes
- **Nitro**: Spacebar for speed boost (3-second cooldown)
- **Pause**: P key to pause/unpause
- **Quit**: Q key to exit

### Scoring System
- Points based on survival time (frame_count ÷ 10)
- High scores automatically saved to `high_score.json`
- New high score celebration with visual feedback

### Difficulty Progression
- Speed increases every 10 seconds (max 3.0x)
- Obstacle spawn rate increases over time (max 80%)
- Nitro provides temporary speed boost for escaping tight situations

## 🛠️ Development Tools

### Makefile Commands
```bash
make help      # Show available commands
make run       # Start the game
make test      # Validate code structure
make check     # Verify system requirements
make stats     # Show project statistics
